Requirements:

I'd like the program to prompt me to either input 1 or -1, and then have it show
a tally of what I entered, how many times I entered, and then be able to reset
at any time. So I could input some thing like the following, and it would show
me the following at every step of the way:

| Input | Tally | Total |
|-------+-------+-------|
|     1 |     1 |     1 |
|    -1 |     0 |     2 |
|     1 |     1 |     3 |
|     1 |     2 |     4 |
|    -1 |     1 |     5 |
